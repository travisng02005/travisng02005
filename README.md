## ✨ Welcome to Travis’s Corner of the Internet ✨

Hi! I’m Travis Ngo — college coder, full-time enjoyer of good UI design, matcha, and building things that probably shouldn’t work… but do.

I like making projects that mix creativity + code, whether that’s:
- turning Flappy Bird into a tongue-controlled chaos machine 🐦👅
- building a virtual closet so I don’t have to pick outfits in real life 👕
- or rendering a 3D Toyota RAV4 because… why not 🚙

🌱 Currently working on:
- Teaching front-end magic to new developers ✨
- Leveling up my React + Tailwind game
- Trying to stop adding “one more feature” at 3am

🧠 Things I enjoy:
- JavaScript that actually behaves
- Java that sometimes behaves
- Python that behaves until it doesn’t

📫 If you want to reach me:

- Or send a carrier pigeon. I can’t guarantee it will arrive, but the vibes are unmatched.
